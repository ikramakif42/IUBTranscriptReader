# IUBTranscriptReader

This is a personal project to help IUB students determine the best courses you can retake to improve your CGPA!

Implemented as a quick script in Python and no UI as of yet, you can connect your Transcript PDF as downloaded from iRAS and choose the number of recommendations you want.

### To be added

One big flaw in the logic so far is not handling paired lab courses, so as of now it recommends theory and lab courses separately. One way I want to fix that is using object-orientation, but I'm all ears for new ideas.
